To whom this may concern,

I am writing to lodge a formal complaint regarding the upkeep of tactile cones across my area. Today, I conducted a check of all tactile cones on the A4198 Junction, leading to the Orbital, Toby Carvery, and the Blunsdon Arms.

On the 18 cones we tested, only 9 worked. Within this correspondence, I have attached a scanned copy of the A4198 Junction, and the faulty tactile cones are circled with an X.

The route was selected as my neighbour is blind, and he quite often (more than once a week) walks to Asda, the Toby and the Blunsdon Arms. He often has no one with him to help, and the other day he was stuck in the middle of the road (see circled area on scanned picture) and could not go back due to both sideâ€™s cones not working. He was stuck there until somebody kindly walked him across. There will not always be someone there to help.

As a council, it is your responsibility to be checking these cones and ensuring they are in good working order. I am submitting a complaint due to this reason.

Please note that under the Highways Act of 1980, you have a statutory duty to ensure roads and paths are maintained. In addition, under the E quality Act of 2010, you have a duty to make reasonable adjustments for those with disabilities.

I am asking that you fix these cones as quickly as possible, and monitor them in the future.

Yours sincerely,\
\

<summary>Case created and in draft - 17th August</summary>

My next door neighbour is blind and relies on tactile cones when crossing busy roads. In a survey we conducted, we found that 50% of cones (9/18) were either faulty or did not work at all. We've contacted Swindon Borough Council and asked them to fix them and routinely monitor them for faults.
